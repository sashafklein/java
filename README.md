This repository includes some code I wrote to solve the first 4 problem sets from Stanford's free CS 106A Java course, as well as one or two problems of my own devising and a few sad cracks at Euler Project questions.

I moved onto other coding projects when I decided Java likely wasn't the best use of my time.
